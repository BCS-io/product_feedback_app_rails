### What I learned

Going backwards is more complicated than I thought. Mainly because in the past I hardcoded paths. However in this design, which I did not change, I had two ways to get to a page, hence, two ways back. So I had to `link_to :back` which hasn't been well explained. [So I wrote a blog post on it.](https://dev.to/notapatch/rails-going-backwards-56h5).

### Continued development

Frontend is such a large topic. I am interested in learning more about Rails Hotwire but equally Javascript frontend frameworks. So many topics, so little time.
