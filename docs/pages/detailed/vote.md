# Vote

A signed in user can vote by clicking on a vote button. If they have not voted on a suggestion the button appears light blue otherwise it is dark blue. Voting is possible on the homepage, the feedback show page and the roadmap page.

- Only a signed in user can vote.
- They can vote on any feedback regardless to state. It does not matter if the feedback is a suggestion, planned, in-progress or live.
- It is immaterial where in the application they vote. It is all the same single vote on that suggestion.
- I added a requirement: They can vote only once on each suggestion.
#### Unvoted - light blue

- Clicking on an unvoted suggestion adds a single vote and means they have now voted
#### Voted - dark blue

- Clicking on a voted suggestion removes a single vote and means they have now not voted on that suggestion
