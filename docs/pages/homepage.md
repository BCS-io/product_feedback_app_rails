# Homepage

The home page provides a list of the suggestions for any visitor to see. They can see the number of votes and comments on any suggestion. Below is the desktop view of the homepage, but the [tablet view](#tablet) and [mobile view](#mobile) have the same options but rearranged differently.

## Responsive views

This is a responsive design and part of the design moves around depending on the class of the view, mobile, tablet or desktop. Mobile design is up to 640px wide. Above that is tablet design, until 768px wide then finally desktop above that.

The application is responsive and includes a tablet and mobile in addition to the [already shown desktop version](#desktop-view-of-homepage).
